Der vorliegende Beitrag prÃ¤sentiert Befunde einer explorativen, interdisziplinÃ¤ren Studie aus den Bereichen Journalismusforschung und Informatik, die sich mit der algorithmischen Klassifizierung und dem Clustern von Nutzerkommentaren beschÃ¤ftigt. Im Gegensatz zu Ã¤hnlichen Vorhaben, die darauf abzielen, Spam- und Hasskommentare herauszufiltern, verfolgt das Projekt einen konstruktiveren Ansatz und fokussiert darauf, Kommentare von besonderem Nutzen oder hoher QualitÃ¤t zu identifizieren, die fÃ¼r journalistische Zwecke genutzt werden kÃ¶nnen. Auf der Basis einer Literaturstudie sowie eigener empirischer Vorarbeiten zur Publikumsbeteiligung wurde ein Mock-up fÃ¼r ein Software-Framework entwickelt, das Journalisten bei der systematischen Analyse von Kommentaren unterstÃ¼tzen soll. Das Mock-up wurde in zwei Gruppendiskussionen mit Kommentarmoderatoren und Redakteuren aus verschiedenen Ressorts evaluiert. Funktionen, die als besonders nÃ¼tzlich erachtet wurden, umfassen u. a. die Klassifizierung von Nutzerkommentaren in Pro- und Contra-Argumente zu einem Artikelthema, die automatisierte Analyse ihrer QualitÃ¤t sowie die Identifikation Ã¼berraschender bzw. auÃergewÃ¶hnlicher Kommentare und solcher, die neue Fragen, Meinungen und Perspektiven enthalten.},

We highlight some of the differences between industry-oriented and academic research settings and their influence on the decisions made in the data collection and annotation processes, selection of document representation and machine learning methods. We report on classification results, where the problems to solve and the data to work with come from a commercial enterprise. In this context typical for NLP research, we discuss relevant industrial aspects. We believe that the challenges faced as well as the solutions proposed for addressing them can provide insights to others working in a similar setting.},
